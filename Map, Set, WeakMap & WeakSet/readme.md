# Key Interview Points:

## **Memory Management**

* WeakMap and WeakSet are particularly useful for preventing memory leaks when working with objects that might be garbage collected
* Regular Maps and Sets maintain strong references and can prevent garbage collection

## **Use Cases**

* Map: When you need key-value pairs with keys of any type, or need to maintain insertion order
* Set: When you need to maintain a collection of unique values
* WeakMap: For storing private data associated with objects, or metadata about objects
* WeakSet: For marking objects (like "has this object been validated?")

## **Performance**

* Maps and Sets generally have better performance than using regular objects for lookups
* WeakMap and WeakSet help with memory management but sacrifice iteration capabilities

## Common Problems with Strong References (Map/Set):

```
// Memory leak example with Map
const userDataCache = new Map();

function processUser(user) {
    userDataCache.set(user, calculateUserData(user));
}

// Even if users are deleted from your system
// their data stays in the Map forever unless manually removed
// Memory keeps growing! ðŸ˜±
```

### Fixed with WeakMap

```
const userDataCache = new WeakMap();

function processUser(user) {
    userDataCache.set(user, calculateUserData(user));
}

// When user objects are no longer used
// their cache entries are automatically removed
// Memory is freed! ðŸ˜Š
```

## Key Interview Points:

1. Regular Maps and Sets keep objects alive in memory even if they're not used anywhere else
2. WeakMaps and WeakSets allow objects to be garbage collected if there are no other references
3. This is why WeakMaps and WeakSets can't be iterated - their contents might disappear at any time!
4. Perfect for caches, metadata storage, and preventing memory leaks

This concept is crucial for memory management in large applications, especially when dealing with DOM elements or large data sets that need to be garbage collected properly.

### **Map**

**Time Complexity:**

* set(key, value): O(1)
* get(key): O(1)
* has(key): O(1)
* delete(key): O(1)
* clear(): O(n)
* size: O(1)
* forEach(): O(n)

**Space Complexity:**

* O(n) where n is the number of key-value pairs

## **Set**

**Time Complexity:**

* add(value): O(1)
* has(value): O(1)
* delete(value): O(1)
* clear(): O(n)
* size: O(1)
* forEach(): O(n)

**Space Complexity:**

* O(n) where n is the number of unique values

## **WeakMap**

**Time Complexity:**

* set(key, value): O(1)
* get(key): O(1)
* has(key): O(1)
* delete(key): O(1)

**Space Complexity:**

* O(n) where n is the number of key-value pairs, but memory can be reclaimed by garbage collector

## **W****eakSet**

**Time Complexity:**

* add(value): O(1)
* has(value): O(1)
* delete(value): O(1)

**Space Complexity:**

* O(n) where n is the number of objects, but memory can be reclaimed by garbage collector

## Key Points for Interviews:

1. All basic operations (add/set, get, has, delete) are O(1) - constant time
2. The main difference in space complexity is that WeakMap and WeakSet allow for garbage collection
3. Maps and Sets maintain references that prevent garbage collection, while WeakMap and WeakSet don't
4. Maps generally have better performance than regular objects for frequent additions and removals

> **Interview Tip:** When discussing complexity, also mention that JavaScript engine implementations might vary slightly, but these are the generally accepted complexities.
